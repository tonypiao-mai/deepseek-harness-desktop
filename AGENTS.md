# DSH Desktop repository rules

This repository owns the desktop product around an unmodified DeepSeek Harness checkout.

> **Tony-managed rolling worktree.** This is a Tony-managed repository (fork of
> `anywhere-labs/deepseek-harness-desktop` under `tonypiao-mai/`). Use the main
> worktree and one rolling feature branch per PR cycle against `origin/master`
> (our fork), following the standing delivery authority in AGENTS.md: commit,
> push a feature branch to `origin`, open a PR against our fork's `master`, and
> merge it once validated. Do **not** push directly to `origin/master` or open
> PRs against the upstream `anywhere-labs/deepseek-harness-desktop` unless
> explicitly requested.

- `deepseek-harness/` is a pinned upstream Git submodule. Never edit files inside it from a desktop feature branch.
- `dsh-plugin-desktop/` owns the Cordis Host and Client faces, Electron bootstrap, packaging, and release tests.
- `dsh-community-fabric/` owns the community interoperability RFC. Until schemas and a reviewed reference adapter exist, it remains a private documentation scaffold and must not declare loadable DSH or package entry points.
- `dsh-community-market/` owns the community-market shell. Until its runtime is implemented, it remains a private documentation scaffold and must not declare loadable DSH or package entry points.
- The outer repository and all owned packages use the root Yarn release with `nodeLinker: node-modules`.
- The upstream submodule keeps its own pnpm workspace. Run upstream commands through the root `upstream:*` scripts, whose Yarn portable-shell commands enter the submodule before invoking Corepack.
- Compatibility mode must run the upstream default client without overrides. Advanced presentation belongs to desktop-owned client plugins and may replace documented slots or services through profile composition.
- Keep graphical application launch explicit. Builds, typechecks, unit tests, and Loader smokes must remain headless-safe.
- Commit before major changes of direction and keep the submodule pin update separate from desktop behavior changes.
- Keep the repository topology and package-manager split consistent with the [owning Agent Note](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-15-pinned-upstream-and-isolated-yarn-workspace.md).
