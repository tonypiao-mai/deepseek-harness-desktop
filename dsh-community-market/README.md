# DSH Community Market

[中文说明](README.zh.md)

DSH Community Market is the planned plugin-market shell for [DSH Desktop](../README.en.md). It will help people discover community plugins, understand what they do, and install them into the active work profile through one clear, confirmed action.

> **Current status: documentation-first scaffold.** This workspace does not yet contain a market page, catalog client, or installer. It is private in the monorepo until the first usable implementation is ready. Do not add it to a DSH profile yet.

## What we are building

The first usable version should make a small, understandable journey possible:

1. Browse and search a community catalog.
2. Open a plugin page with its description, source repository, and trust warning.
3. Choose **Install** and confirm the exact plugin and active profile.
4. Let Desktop run the existing managed DSH plugin command.
5. Prompt the user to restart Desktop when the profile change is complete.

The market is a shell around existing DSH capabilities. It does not invent a second plugin format, package manager, profile store, or privileged installer.

## Catalog sources

The market has no default catalog. People choose which sources to enable, may change their order, and may add a source that implements the published catalog contract. Each source is isolated behind an adapter, and the market UI sees only the same validated, normalized data model.

[DSH 1024Store](https://github.com/imsai-sh/awesome-deepseek-harness-plugins) is one of the catalog providers currently cooperating with this project. We plan to ship a reviewed adapter for its public API, but the cooperation does not make it enabled by default, preferred in sorting, a fallback when no source is selected, or an endorsement of its listings. That project independently maintains its discovery, validation, website, API, and the separately published `dsh-1024store` plugin. DSH Community Market is not a fork, repackaging, or official client of that plugin.

All catalog data is remote and untrusted. A listing means only that a provider supplied metadata; it does **not** mean that Anywhere Labs reviewed, recommends, or guarantees the plugin.

## Safety promise

- Background browsing never installs a package or executes repository code.
- Installation starts only after an explicit user action and confirmation.
- The market will independently resolve and pin an install target from a validated package or repository identity; it will never execute a command string returned by a catalog.
- The confirmation will show the exact source and active profile.
- Plugin changes will use the existing Desktop-managed DSH plugin service and run one operation at a time.
- The first release will not include accounts, telemetry, silent installs, automatic plugin updates, or a catalog backend.

Plugins run as local code with the user's permissions and may run package lifecycle scripts during installation. Read [Security](SECURITY.md) before implementing or reviewing installation behavior.

## Documentation

- [Market shell design](docs/market-shell.md): product boundary, architecture, profiles, failure behavior, and delivery phases.
- [Catalog provider contract](docs/catalog-provider-contract.md): source manifests, query parameters, wire and normalized JSON, multi-source behavior, and the implementation handoff.
- [Security](SECURITY.md): trust model, reporting, and non-negotiable installation rules.
- [Desktop plugin services](../dsh-plugin-desktop/docs/plugin-services.md): the existing `desktopProfiles` and `desktopPnpm` contracts the future implementation will consume.
- [DSH plugin development](../docs/plugin-development.en.md): the shared plugin model used by ordinary DSH and Desktop.

## Delivery plan

- **Phase 0 — current:** package ownership, documentation, trust boundary, and headless checks.
- **Phase 1:** source selection, user-added conforming sources, multi-source read-only browsing, search, categories, plugin details, and complete loading/empty/error states.
- **Phase 2:** explicit installation into the active profile through the managed Desktop service.
- **Later:** uninstall, update, recovery, and richer verification signals.

Catalog collection, submission review, accounts, rankings, and hosting remain the responsibility of catalog providers rather than this package.
